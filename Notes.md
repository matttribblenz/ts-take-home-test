## Things that could be added to the codebase

- OpenAPI schema
  - Autogenerated typing for client API access
- Database ORM
- Brand object type extensibility (separate brand table, foreign keyed on brandId etc etc)
- Translation library
- IAC
- Better Logging
- User session tracking
- More extensive UI tests (end to end, functionality tests, component/hook logic unit tests)
- Authentication (client -> server, user authentication, permissions, there's no auth of any kind)

## Codebase Issues

- No API schema validation / proper error handling (might be implementations in @oak, not sure)
- No SQL sanitisation (would be fixed with ORM)
- Schema is kind of all over the place (Row type, Zod type)
- Frontend not set up for robust API data handling (caching, invalidation, optimistic updates)


## Team Scalability Issues
- The frontend and backend are not separated enough
  - Schema updates on the backend need to be manually changed on the frontend
- No CI pipeline for unit, integration, end to end, UI tests
- No documentation (architecture, infrastructure, code formatting and quality)
- Not set up for database migrations
